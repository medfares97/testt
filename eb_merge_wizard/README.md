# Euroblaze Merge Tasks Module
This module is used to archive multiple tasks, at once.
# About eb_archive_tasks
Merging tasks was not possible before. Now with the Module from Euroblaze this possibility is there, just a few
clicks away. Select multiple multiple tasks from the list view and click on MERGE TASKS in the Action.
# Installation

Use git clone or just download the .zip package files, unzip at the addons directory, update the modules list and install the module. No further configuration is needed, you are good to go.

Have a great time user. It's a NEBIZ® creation. Merge multiple tasks with merge_tasks_wizard!!! Cheers.
